Code-Quiz


##Description

This wwek's challeng is about building a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that am going to write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.  

The code quiz will be acess based on the following requirement: 
A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
Questions contain buttons for each answer.
When answer is clicked, the next question appears
If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock
The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score
